## Syntax Notes
- Be sure to end every line with a ;
- Just like C
- MySQL commands are case insensitive
- COMMENT YOUR CODE! use `--` or `/* blah blah blah */` for multi line comments

## Databaes and Tables
- Databases are the parents
- Databaeses live on servers
- Data lives on Tables inside the Databases
- Can have many tables inside one database
- Tables = HONKIN' Spreadsheets

## Data Types
- [Different INT Type Sizes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/integer-types.html)
- Be mindful about the size and type that you use
- [Numeric Types](https://ds.codeup.com/sql/tables/#numeric-types)
- [String Types](https://ds.codeup.com/sql/tables/#string-types)
- [Date Types](https://ds.codeup.com/sql/tables/#date-types)
- NULL means there's nothing here. not 0. nothing is there
- can allow NULLs, can prohibit them
    - if verboten, you'll get an error
    - allowing NULLs will give you holes in your data
